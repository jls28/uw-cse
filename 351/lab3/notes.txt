01040c address for smoke in the assembly code. check for addresses.
add _56_ or 58? 54? chars and then return. just look at the stack.

00 00 00 00 00 00 40 10 c0

for the last part, i need to stick all 0s in the first param register, and then call bang, so

movq $0, %rdi
call 401020

return adress should be 0xffffbe00 + amount of bytes the above args are
0xffffbe0d

get the rbp
goes before the return
have the return call my new function that sets rax to my cookie
and then return 
b570
