Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
	because it threw when n <= 0, and n == 0. Changed first if statement to be n < 0
Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
	it had <= 2 instead of < 2. Corrected
Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix it?
	inductive cases were getting subtracted instead of added. fixed.
