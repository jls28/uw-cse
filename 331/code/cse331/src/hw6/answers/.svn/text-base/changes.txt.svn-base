* Made Edge class implement comparable, sorts by character name and then by book name

* Added a removeEdge() method to Graph, although it's not used anywhere (for method Nirvana)

* Added a deepCopy() method to Graph(), although it's not used anywhere (anymore, MarvelPaths used to be a stateful ADT
before I realized that was kind of silly)

* Added a getSortedEdges(parent) method to Graph(), so output would match for listChildren() in test driver

* Added Unit tests for all of the above in hw5
