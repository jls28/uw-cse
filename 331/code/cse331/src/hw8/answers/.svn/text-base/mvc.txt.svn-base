For this assignment I kept my model, view, and controller very separate.

CampusPathsTextInputController is the console based controller for CampusPaths. All it does
is receive input on System.in and then calls methods on it's model. It _never_ prints. Conversely,
CampusPathsTextView is a text based view for CampusPaths, and is added to a list of views in the model
with the observer pattern. Whenever the model needs to update a view, it iterates through this list
of views and calls the appropriate methods. CampusPathsTextView only prints and never takes input.
