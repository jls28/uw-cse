Alice keeps her notes in the file /home/alice/notes.txt. Suppose youâ€™re writing a program to help her.

She wants to append a note at the end of the file. Describe the sequence of system calls your program would invoke.

In bash, the trivial solution would be to echo "note content to append" >> /home/alice/notes.txt
The system calls would be something like read /home/alice/notes.txt into a buffer in the program, append
the text (presumably from an argument to the program), and then overwrite /home/alice/notes.txt with the
content of the buffer.


What if she wants to insert a few words at the beginning of the file? Would the same sequence of system calls work? If not,
describe a new plan.

In this case, the file could be read into a buffer, then she overwrites /home/alice/notes.txt with the
words she wants to add, then does an append with the old contents of /home/alice/notes.txt that's in
the buffer
