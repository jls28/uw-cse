Memory Management

Memory leaks

lifetime of data


I/O and buffering

which IO calls buffer to where
  write: goes to kernel buffer <- kernel
  fwrite: goes to C library buffer 
  fflush: flushes library buffer to kernel
  fsync: flushes to disk 
  sync: kernel 
  close : data NOT written to disk

C++
  syntax:
  const, type signatures
  const method
  can always upgrade to const, cant downgrade from const
  if passing a const object ref, any object.method()s called need to also be const
  operator overloading
  inheritance

  want to make destructors virtual
  class base {
  ~base();
  }
  class dirived: public base {
  ~derived();
  };

  Base * b = new Derived();
  delete b;
  ~~~base destrcutor will get called if destructor not virtual~~~
  if virtual, looks

  initializer lists
